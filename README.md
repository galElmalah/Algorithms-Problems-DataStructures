# Algorithms-Problems-DataStructures
A collection of Algorithms, Data structures and common interview problems ( mostly written in JavaScript).

# Todos: 
1. Put each solution in a different folder with its own README file.
2. Separate each problem/algo/ds folder to different folders for each language the solution is available.
3. Add links on the main readme file to each problem/algo/ds.
4. Add tests for all of the problems/algos/ds.

# Contributing:
+ As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown and code.
+ Make sure that 100% of your code is covered by tests.
+ If you're adding new algorithms or data structures please provide README.md for each of them with explanations of the algorithm and with links to further readings.
+ If you're adding an existing algorithm, data structure or a problem but in a different language please make sure you put it in a folder indicating the language you used and include all of the tests as well.
+ Feel free to suggest improvemnts or to add READEME.md files to existing algorithms, data structures and problems that dont have one.
+ If you're changing existing code please make sure to run the relevant tests before making a pull request.
